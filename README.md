*Text Classifier [Source](https://medium.com/text-classification-algorithms/text-classification-algorithms-a-survey-a215b7ab7e2d)*

## In this repository, we aim to construct a basic text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm from the ground up. Additionally, we have created a blog post to explain the concepts underlying Naive Bayes.

* We utilize the [Rotten Tomatoes Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/rotten-tomatoes-reviews) from Kaggle in our implementation.
* Our investigation covers an understanding of Bayes' Theorem and Naive Bayes assumptions.
* Furthermore, we conduct experiments with Laplace smoothing, the removal of less frequent words, and the elimination of stop words to gain a better understanding of their effects.

I recommended that you start with reading this Medium [blog]() post for better understanding of the code.
